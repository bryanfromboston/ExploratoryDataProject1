## From the Student:

This is my submission for R Programming Exploratory Data Analysis, Course Project 1. Here are a few notes on my implementation:

### Loading the Data

* Because I didn't want to push the raw data into git (the file is too big), I chose to download the zip file directly, unzip it, and then process the data from the unzipped temp file.
* I've abstracted the data load into a function, found in [getData.R](getData.R).
* There are TODO action items in the comments: They are only for me to continue to improve upon the solution, not an indication of incomplete code. :)
